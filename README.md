# Android Flight Simulator
### General
In this project, we built a android app with java which is designed in MVVM architecture, that is communicating with the app "FlightGear".<br />
The app contains a connection part - to the "FlightGear" app with IP and port, and a joystick + seekbars to control the aircraft on the "FlightGear" app.
